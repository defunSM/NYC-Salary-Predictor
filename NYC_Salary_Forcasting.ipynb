    "This dataset contains citywide payroll information for government jobs in NYC. We are interested in understanding more about NYC salaries and potentially develop a model in order to predict gross pay. In order to do so we perform a exploratory data analysis of the dataset to figure out which features of interest we want to use in our models. We will also have to do preprocessing and handling categorical data and convert them into numerical data for our model to use."

    "Using the covariance matrix we can see some clear correlations such as the regular hours has a huge impact on regular gross paid with a high correlation of 0.82. Same goes for the correlation between total gross pay and regular gross_paid which means that the regular gross paid is pretty much included in the total gross pay. We can see that the two things that affect the total gross pay the most is the regular hours and the regular gross paid.\n",
